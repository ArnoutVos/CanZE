    * Renault Zoé
      This image is all around the Internet. I can't remember where exactly where it has been taken
      from, but I think it has come from some official Renault site, but I can't find it right now.
      For the same reason, I cannot indicate the license of this image right now, but as it can be
      found on many sites, I suppose it may be at least usable without modifications for non-commercial
      use. I would be grateful for any more precise information ...
